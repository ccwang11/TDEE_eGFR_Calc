There are significant concerns regarding the nutritional needs of elderly, ill, hospitalized, or long-term care patients. This user-friendly form allows you to quickly assess caloric and protein requirements based on factors such as basal metabolic rate, activity level, stress level, and renal function. Additionally, you can compare the current feeding formula or oral intake with the estimated nutritional needs. The form includes a variety of commercial formulas. It was originally created in Traditional Chinese for my colleagues.
